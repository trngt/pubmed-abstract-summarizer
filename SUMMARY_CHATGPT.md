# PubMed Abstract Summarizer - A Collaborative Journey

This project is the result of a collaborative effort between a user and an AI assistant. Together, they built a web application that generates summaries of PubMed abstracts using OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## The Process

1. **Designing the application:** The user asked for help in building an application that summarizes PubMed abstracts. The AI assistant suggested a plan involving a React-based frontend, a proxy server, and the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT API.

2. **Implementing the application step-by-step:** The AI assistant provided detailed instructions for each step of the process, from setting up the frontend to integrating the ChatGPT API. However, due to the assistant's response limitations, some responses were truncated, and the user had to ask for clarifications and additional information to complete each step.

3. **Addressing issues and errors:** As the user worked through the implementation, they encountered various errors and issues. The user shared these error messages and issues with the AI assistant, who then helped debug and resolve the problems.

4. **Adjusting the implementation:** The AI assistant offered alternative solutions whenever the user encountered challenges, such as suggesting a different proxy server port when the default port was unavailable.

5. **Securing API keys:** The user learned about securing API keys by creating a `.env` file and using environment variables. This ensured that sensitive information was not exposed in the source code.

6. **Deployment considerations:** The user asked about deploying the application and whether the proxy server was still necessary. The AI assistant explained that the proxy server was needed to avoid CORS policy issues and recommended a deployment strategy.

7. **Creating documentation:** The AI assistant generated a technical README in Markdown format, which the user could copy and paste into their project repository. Additionally, the AI assistant provided a suggested repository name and description.

This project showcases the power of collaboration between humans and AI, demonstrating how AI can assist in creating, debugging, and documenting software applications.
